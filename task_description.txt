HOME TASK


During this task you will perform these assignments.



Use this dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srinuti/residential-power-usage-3years-data-timeseries

// Combine temperature and electric usage datasets into one dataset.
Think like that, electric usage is “meter” and  temperature values are “driver”

//I want to combine hdd and cdd values on given time period && given location. You can reach location from data card.

Make exploratory analysis on data(Correlation,single regression,etc… but I want these : Create functions for [Correlation between selected driver and selected meter],[Correlation between all drivers],[Single Regression between selected meter and selected Driver]).

Visualize your work but I want to see also results of analysis in json format in possible analysis.

Create a neural network and make make prediction for next 2 months electric usage  with regression(Time period is from past so you can reach them).

Forecast a time series analysis and predict next 2 months 

Compare these two methods with metrics.
